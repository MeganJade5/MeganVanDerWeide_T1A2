           <ul> 
                <li> Megan aims to complete 100 days of code by the end of 2022. </li><br>

                <li> Develop projects for my Entrepreneurial partner who plans to open a new gym in Sydney. </li>

                <li>My grandfather was my biggest inspiration to switch industries as he was a pioneer in the IT space.
                   I will make my grandfather proud by carrying on his legacy and continuing to evolve the space as he did.</li><br>

                <li> In my career I will diversify the stereotype of the tech world being a male dominated industry. 
                  Alike to my own personal journey of being inspired and encouraged by others to pursue a career in tech, 
                  I hope to inspire others too. As someone who has already broken the barriers of being “a woman in a 
                  man's role”, I hope to be a role model in the tech world too. In my success in the tech world I plan 
                  to inspire other young women to feel confident enough to enter and continue to be in the tech world.</li><br>

                  <li>I will to always be approachable for those following my journey 
                  to find me as a friend or colleague to confide in. I will continuously network with other likeminded women 
                  in the industry to share our knowledge and experiences to improve the tech space even more. 
                  I intend to constantly perform small acts such as setting an example, being welcoming, having patience and 
                  empathy towards others which will encourage the changes that we wish to see in the tech workplace culture.</li><br>

                <li>I intend to always use strategies from my collabortive theatre background to build products that a users and client enjoy, 
                  I will use my education background and degree to form creative ideas into logical ones that fills the brief and beyond. 
                  I will uphold my scrappy, entrepreneurial spirit born from many years of freelancing and self-employment.</li><br>

                <li> Long term goal: Reinvent the automation in Australia and reduce the sourcing of using personal from other countries 
                  to fix the backend issues of fault finding. </li>
