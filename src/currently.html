            Hello my name is Megan Van Der Weide and Iâ€™m a 26 year old professional 
            in the backstage entertainment industry who specialises in performer flying and automation. 
            I have found that programming automation for live productions can be rather similar to the world of tech, 
            the only big difference is that I don't have peoples lives at my finger tips when writing code in the tech world.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;"> 
            I am currently pursuing a Diploma of Information Technology with Coder Academy in Sydney.
            This fast paced learning has allowed for me to learn web development coding such as: 
            HTML, CSS, Ruby, Javascript and all the intricacy and rabit holes that come with it. 
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">
            I pride myself on my ability to communicate and collaborate with creatives, artists, clients and colleagues. Other skills that I have developed include but are not limited to; my attention to detail, 
            logistical organision, positive attitude, extreme ability to focus, passion in my work and dedication. I have exposure to being a leader, mentor and I am efficient in 
            working within a team environment.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">
            In my life outside of work I like keeping active at my partners gym, pole dancing classes, walking my Border Collie
            "Mrs Peanut Butter" and hiking in a new city. In addition with my extensive background working in the arts I love to watch (and maybe judge) 
            live productions.  
          </p>
