#Purpose

The purpose of this website is to showcase my coding skills, present my professional personality and to drive my audience to contact me for a job in web development. This call to action is achieved through the portfolios structure, layout, responsive design, content and style. In addition the website is to be accessible from any device and for all audiences. 

The website aims to appeal to the curiosity of my audience by inviting them into my personal story. The written content provides the hard and soft skills required for the position. The content gives the audience a personal story about what education, training and experiences that the subject has had. The website purposefully speaks to the audience in a professional tone whilst also showcasing the quirky individual self in order to provide evidence of good communication skills and interpersonal skills. 

The websites is designed to capture the audiences attention. By styling with a minimalist approach the user experience simple and easy to use. The layout is focused on making the information clear and cohesive whilst also presenting the subject with a brand identity. 
The website is a prequel to the CV provided and the styling choices reflect this. 

#Functionality and Features

The site is across 6 pages with external and internal links to blog posts, social media links and CV. The portfolio site is structured with breadcrumbs of navigation, with every page having links to the other through a navigation bar. In addition there are elements of interactive navigations through graphical and textual components. Both versions of navigation ensures that the busy audience can navigate the website simply and not be irritated by any complexities or confusion. All pages have a footer which leads to the “contact page.” Every page has the direct ability for the viewer to contact the subject, therefore fulfilling the websites purpose.

**Homepage:** The homepage has a striking headshot to give the audience a “face to the name” and form a personable relationship. The icons on this page immediately provides the audience with professional websites such as LinkedIn and Github and contact details such as email and CV. Scrolling on from the image, the page provides interactive navigation with images that are buttons navigation to each page. Below these buttons are small blurbs which can entice the viewer to want to click on and read more. The page is sewed together with a footer with a link leading to the contact page. The homepage uses both the icon links and the contact page link to offer a quick navigation to contact the subject. 

**‘Currently’ page:** The contact page has a cohesive design to the rest of the website. It has both the navigation and footer bar as the other pages. The page has similar styling to the homepage which is shown with using an image of half of the face. Under the title, the page provides content describing the subject and their skills and interests. The page also provides a link to the Github profile.

**‘Previously’ page:** The previously page mirrors the contact page with similar design features. These features involve the other half of the image, the same placement and styling with a navigation bar and footer. The content gives the viewer the subjects working history and personal journey. The page also links to the LinkedIn profile. 

**Blogs:** The blog page has a similar navigation as the homepage which gives the website a cohesive style. It uses the individual blog background images as buttons. When the images are pressed it leads to the blog post. Below these images are titles, dates and a short description to hook the attention and highlight the important information of each blog. The blog page has a navigation bar and the important call to action in the footer, which leads to the contact page. 

**Individual Blogs (1,2,3,4,5):** The blogs have the main title, date and author. The blogs text is presented in front of the graphical image. All blogs have a navigation bar back to the main blog page and homepage. The blogs are consistent to other pages with the familiar footer. 

**Goals Page:** The site uses the goals page to present to the viewer that the subject has a positive work ethic and passion towards the industry. The page follows the same approach of a recurring image as the header with the overlay of the page title. The content is a listed approach of the subjects personal and professional goals. 

**Contact page:** This page is a form for the viewer to question or query the subject directly from the website. The viewer is also met with a professional image of the subject working, again reminding the audience of the personal story. The contact page has the consistent navigation bar which leads to all other main pages. In addition there is a footer bar with the familiar icons from the homepage which leads social media links, email, and CV. The contact page is a full circle moment to remind the viewer to reach out to the person that they’re viewing. 

**CV:** The CV is found on the homepage and contact page as an external button. When pressed the user receives a downloaded PDF version. The website is the prequel to the CV and it shares familiar design colours and line drawings as found on the homepage. These design features are to intertwine the two and stamp the brand identity into the audiences memory. 

#Sitemap

The site flows by showcasing the content with a start middle and end. This is achieved through smooth navigations between each page. The site begins with the homepage which has the subjects name and important content such as relevant skills and professional links. The site then provides the viewer with updated information in “currently” and then gives the viewer the subjects history in “previously.” It then allows the user to navigate to the viewers blogs. The navigation then leads to the subjects future goal page. Finally the site is sandwiched with the contact page.
