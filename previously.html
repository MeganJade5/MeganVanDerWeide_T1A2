          <p style="text-align: left; font-size: 0.9rem;">
          My industry experience lead me to spending many years as a professional in the backstage
          entertainment industry who specialised in performer flying and
          automation. The best way that I'm able to explain my job to my parents and friends
          (outside of the industry) is, I make things ie. walls and floors or
          people move with computers.</p> 

          <p style="text-align: left; font-size: 0.9rem;">
          This profession allowed for me to practice my craft all around the
          world including touring large commercial productions and many years
          sailing on cruiseships with Royal Carribbean. My proudest title was 
          the 'Show Rigger' On Harry Potter and The Cursed Child in Melbourne Australia.  </p>
          
          <p style="text-align: left;font-size: 0.9rem;">
          In my 10 years of exposure in this industry I had found that I had 
          worked my way the ladder from a stage hand, to a manager and to a high risk rigger and now I'm seeking more. 
          I was and still am, one of the few women in automation/rigging in my industry, a job that was seen
          predominantly for men. I stayed and progressed
          in these roles even when the odds were against me. I will use this
          leadership mindset and passion to progress myself as a figurehead in
          the tech space to endorse fellow young women to embark on a similar career
          path.
