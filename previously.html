          My industry experience began as a professional in the backstage
          entertainment industry who specialised in performer flying and
          automation. The best way I explain my job to my parents and friends
          (outside of the industry) is, I make things ie. walls and floors or
          people move with computers. Over my 10 years of exposure in the
          entertainment industry I worked my way up in the industry from a stage
          hand, to a manager and to a high risk rigger. I was one of the few
          women in automation/rigging in my industry, a job that was seen
          predominantly for men.
          </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">
          This profession allowed for me to practice my craft all around the
          world including touring large commercial productions and many years
          sailing on cruiseship with Royal Carribbean. I stayed and progressed
          in these roles even when the odds were against me. Having my opinions
          shut down and questioned created motivation for me to push even harder
          to ensure safety and efficiency in my workplace.  I will use this
          leadership mindset and passion to progress myself as a figurehead in
          the space to endorse fellow young women to embark on a similar career
          path. </p><br>
